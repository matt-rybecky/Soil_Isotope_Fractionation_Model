This work builds upon fundamental research in isotope geochemistry and
soil physics. Key theoretical foundations include:

- Craig-Gordon equilibration theory
- Horita & Wesolowski (1994) fractionation factor formulation  
- Molecular diffusion theory in porous media
- Boundary layer meteorology principles

The Python implementation was developed to make these advanced modeling
capabilities accessible to the broader research community.
